    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sadza is a staple in a lot of African countries, especially South Africa and East Africa.
       It is a very ”thick porridge” made from finely ground white cornmeal popularly known as 
       mealie meal. It is similar to polenta but thicker in texture, and it is usually served as 
       an accompaniment to meat and vegetable soups and stews.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>  
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>2 cups of fine cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt (optional)</li>
        <li>200g of collard greens</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol> 
        <li>Make the Pap by mixing the water with a cup of cornmeal and salt. Place on medium heat and continue to stir until the light Pap is formed. Then leave the Pap to come to cook—about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and start adding the remaining cornmeal a little at a time, continually stirring until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Cover and leave to cook on a low heat for 10 to 15 minutes. Stir a couple of turns again.</li>
        <li>Cook further if too soft (it gets thicker the longer it cooks) or add a bit of water if too thick and stir a couple of times till the water is absorbed and the sadza is uniformly combined.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve with your choice of relish!</li>
    </ol>
